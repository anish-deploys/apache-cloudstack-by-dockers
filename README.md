# Installation of Apache CloudStack by Dockers üê≥

Apache CloudStack is an open-source cloud management platform designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, providing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) capabilities. CloudStack is commonly used by service providers and enterprises looking to build large-scale cloud infrastructures similar to AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure but in a self-managed environment.

### Updates the package lists for available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.

     sudo apt update 

### Installs the necessary packages to enable HTTPS for APT, manage SSL certificates, download files using curl, and add/manage software repositories.

     sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common 

### Downloads the Docker GPG key and adds it to the system's list of trusted keys for verifying Docker packages.

     curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -  

### Adds the Docker repository for Ubuntu Focal (20.04) to the system's APT sources for downloading and installing Docker packages.

     sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable" 

### Displays the installed version (if any) and available versions of the Docker CE (Community Edition) package, along with information about the repository sources from which Docker can be installed.

     apt-cache policy docker-ce 

### Installs Docker Community Edition (Docker CE) on the system from the available package repositories.

     sudo apt install docker-ce 
     
### Displays the current status of the Docker service, showing whether it is active (running), inactive, or failed, along with additional service information and logs.

     sudo docker info 
     
### Downloads and runs the "hello-world" Docker image, which serves as a test to verify that Docker is installed and working correctly by displaying a message.

     sudo docker run hello-world 
     
### Shows the most recently created container, including its ID, image name, command, creation time, status, and assigned name. In this case, it indicates that the "hello-world" container exited successfully shortly after running.

     sudo docker ps -l 
     
### Runs a Docker container named "cloudstack-simulator" from the "apache/cloudstacksimulator" image, mapping port 8080 on the host to port 5050 in the container, and runs it in detached mode (in the background).

     sudo docker run --name cloudstack-simulator -p 8080:5050 -d apache/cloudstacksimulator 

### To check info & installation about apache cloudstack container.

     sudo docker ps -l 

### Starts the stopped Docker container named "cloudstack-simulator." 

     sudo docker start cloudstack-simulator
