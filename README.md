### 4. ~ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable" : adds the Docker repository for Ubuntu Focal (20.04) to the system's APT sources for downloading and installing Docker packages.

### 5. ~ apt-cache policy docker-ce : displays the installed version (if any) and available versions of the Docker CE (Community Edition) package, along with information about the repository sources from which Docker can be installed.

### 6. ~ sudo apt install docker-ce : installs Docker Community Edition (Docker CE) on the system from the available package repositories.
